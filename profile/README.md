## About Us ðŸ“–

**_It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and
bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he
may give you._** (John 15:16)

### v-bible: Bringing the Word of God to Everyone

v-bible (short for Vietnamese Bible) is a passionate community of believersâ€”both
Catholic and those from other faith journeysâ€”dedicated to spreading the Gospel.
Our innovative bible app is designed not only to offer the Vietnamese Bible but
also to provide a rich collection of Catholic resources, including prayers,
catechisms, and more. Where possible, we will also include translations in
multiple languages to ensure that our spiritual resources are accessible to all.

### Our Mission

We strive to create a welcoming, comprehensive platform where individuals can
explore and deepen their understanding of Catholicism, nurture their faith, and
share the light of God with others.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where the Gospel is shared across all platforms, ensuring
that everyone has the opportunity to connect with the transformative power of
Godâ€™s Word.

While we may be starting this journey as a small team, we are driven by a deep
commitment and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We eagerly look forward to
growing our community and welcoming more members to join us in this sacred
mission.
